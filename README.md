```

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The programming language used for the entire project.
- **NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)**: For text processing, tokenization, and lemmatization.
- **scikit-learn**: For implementing machine learning models and evaluation.
- **Pandas**: For data handling and manipulation.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For data visualization.

## Installation
To run this project, ensure you have Python installed, along with the required libraries. You can install the necessary libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install nltk scikit-learn pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
```

You will also need to download the necessary NLTK resources. You can do this by running the following Python code:

```python
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('stopwords')
nltk.download('wordnet')
nltk.download('averaged_perceptron_tagger')
```

## Data
The dataset used in this project is a CSV file containing tweets related to airlines along with their corresponding sentiments. Replace `your_file.csv` in the code with the actual name of your dataset file.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Ensure that the dataset is in the same directory as the Python script or update the path accordingly.
3. Run the main script using Python:

   ```bash
   python twitter_airline_sentiment_analysis.py
   ```

4. Review the console output for the classification report, confusion matrix, accuracy score, and to visualize the results graphically.

## Results
The project will output the performance metrics of the sentiment analysis model, including:
- Classification Report
- Confusion Matrix
- Accuracy Score
- Visualization of Actual vs Predicted Sentiments

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of natural language processing and machine learning on social media data to extract sentiments. The insights gathered can be used to improve customer service and understand public perception of airlines based on tweets.
